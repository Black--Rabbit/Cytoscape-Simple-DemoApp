This is the demo app made for GSoC 2013 proposal so as to show my familarity with Cytoscape 3.0 app development.
This is a simple app which prints Hello Cytoscape 3! on terminal.

How to run it-
1) launch cytoscape from the terminal,( execute cytoscape.sh from terminal )
2) go to App menu then install this app from the directory of you computer.

Hello Cytoscape 3! can be seen in the terminal.
